Assignment 1 for CSC421: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
In this assignment we were required to implement serveral search-based algorithms.
The main problem is to navigate from a start node to a destination node in a hexagonal grid.
The grid is randomly generated and there are several "blocked" edges.
The algorithms implemented include:
	DFS
	BFS
	A*
	Greedy Search : Using mahattan distance as heuristice
	Hill-Climb : Using a custom heuristic function



states:    
    A graph representing the edges between the tiles.
    A current tile in which the robot resides
    
initial state:
    a random hex-tile

actions:
    move in one of the six possible directionns from the current tile.

transition model:
    given a state and an action return the new state.
    take an action, move to the other node.

goal test:
    check to see if the current tile is the desired final tile

path cost: 
    each move costs 1.




For my given arrangment of the tiles:
    1) general direction of my tiles form a hexagon.
    choose children tiles whose direction is closest.
    2) manhattan distance. record the distance when gerenating each of the
    nodes, thereby allowing you to calculate the absolute distance between nodes
    choose the nodes which are closer.

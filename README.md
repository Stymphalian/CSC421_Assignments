#Introduction
For CSC421: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
A repository to showcase my work on the assignments for the AI class

##Assignment 1
In this assignment we were required to implement serveral search-based algorithms.
The main problem is to navigate from a start node to a destination node in a hexagonal grid.
The grid is randomly generated and there are several "blocked" edges.
The algorithms implemented include:
	DFS
	BFS
	A*
	Greedy Search : Using mahattan distance as heuristice
	Hill-Climb : Using a custom heuristic function


##Assignment 2
In this assignment we became more familiar with propositional logic and FOL.
We were required to implement a simple truth evaulator as well as formula matcher.
Additionally, we were asekd to write a simple Prolog program.

##Assignment 3
Application of basic probability theory. Create a simple email categorization program.
Use of simple bayesian networks and learning decision trees on toy scenarios.
